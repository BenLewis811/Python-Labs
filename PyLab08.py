  Program: CSC115/170 Lab 08 - The Map of Destiny
 ----------------------------
  Partner 1:  Ben Lewis
  Partner 1s contributions: First plot, and total original distance calculations

  Partner 2: Esten Odney
  Partner 2s contributions: Completed the second plot, The closing narrative, and some debugging
  
  Date: 
      
      
  Tips:
    1. Read the entire Lab PDF so you understand what you need to do
    2. Describe each partners contributions - not just "Nate did part 1..."
    3. Use proper coding standards
        * All import statements at the top of the code
        * Any constants come next
        * All functions must be placed right after the imports and the constants
        * All functions must have Docstrings describing functionality, parameters, returns and an 
        example
        * Comment your code well - explain WHY you are doing it
        * Space out your code to make it more readable. Use blank lines and spaces around 
        operators. Use a blank line before and after functions, conditionals and logical blocks.
        * No lines should go past 100 characters wide 
    4. Try not to repeat code.  Use functions and loops. 
    5. Do not use structures or libraries we have not covered in class yet (up through Unit 7)
    6. Rerun the code and test the output before submitting
    7. Work on the lab a little each day. Come to the help sessions if you need assistance
    8. Feel free to change the print snippets and commenting I put in the template.

            After learning the fate of the forest, you realise how quickly Morvath must be stopped.
      You ask Nyssa what to do, and she hands you a magical map. This map reveals your journey so 
      far, and shows hidden passeges through the forest. The map lays out a path to lead you to the
      ancient stones. These stones hide the lair of Morvath. While the map has told you where to 
      to, it will not protect you from his dark magic.

   With the map now displaying a glowing dotted line like a fantasy GPS, you mutter,
"Should've brought snacks for this dramatic final walk." Ducky Momo looks up at you and 
quacks, "If I wanted a mud bath, Iâ€™d have booked a spa day!" as you slosh through another 
puddle that definitely wasn't on the map.

The "ancient stones" turn out to look suspiciously like a villain's Airbnb listing - 
complete with ominous glowing pentagram welcome mat. "5/5 stars would summon dark forces 
again," you joke nervously, while your duck hides behind a suspiciously normal-looking 
shrub.

With a deep breath and your duck sporting a tiny battle helmet, you declare: "Let's 
get this over with before the local tavern closes for last call!" The Syntak better 
be under that rock. That specific rock. No, the other rock.
