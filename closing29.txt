    You stab Morvath through the heart, and after a long and hard fought battle, he is finally 
defeated. It took you and Ducky Momo all youre strength, but Morvath will never hurt the forest 
again. Exhausted from the battle, you collapse. 

    You wake up, unsure if you even won the fight. You quickly grab your sword, preparing for the 
worst. However, Nyssa is there to assure you everything is okay. You look around, realizing life 
has begun to return to the forest.  Animals are returning, and the magic of the forest has already
started to grow shrubs where the old trees had fallen. Relief floods you, as you realize everything
is going to be okay. 

    You glance over at Ducky Momo, who is still sound asleep. The battle tired him out so much he 
wasn't even able to return to your sword. You look back towards Nyssa, but she has dissapeared into
the forest. However, in her place lies a new magical map. Hopefully, this new adventure will be a 
little less daunting.
