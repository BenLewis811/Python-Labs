    You follow the magical map towards the lair of the evil wizard Morvath. At first everything 
appears fine. The birds are chirping, animals scurry through the woodland, and there is a slight 
but warm breeze as you navigate the forest. Throughout the first day of travels, everything seems 
undisturbed. You make quick progress, and are able to get a good nights rest after the first day. 

    On the second day of the journey, you immediately sense that something is afoul. The sky is 
dark, and none of the forest animals are visible. An uneasy silence surrounds you, there's no
sounds of woodland creatures, they have all fled or burrowed deep into the forest floor. The 
breeze has stopped, and the air is cold and damp. Knowing what will happen if you fail your
mission, you decide to prevail onward. As you make your way closer to Morvath, the weather 
continues to get worse and worse.  

    As you reach the final half of your journey, heavens open and a torrential downpour ensues. 
Strong winds tear through the forest, and you are pelted by a freezing rain. Morvath's magic is in 
full force. He has sensed that you are closing in on him, and he is determined to stop you. The 
weakened forest struggles to survive his dark magic. The winds knock over trees, and the ground 
has turned to a muddy sludge. Sleeping has become impossible, and every second you have to be on 
your toes to avoid being crushed by the collapsing forest. Yet, after a grueling day and a half of 
travel, you finally arrive at the entrance of Morvath's grotto, ready for battle.
